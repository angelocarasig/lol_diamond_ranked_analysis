    "Recent years has shown exponential growth towards the eSports genre, with League of Legends currently standing as one of the most popular video game and eSport being played in the world with over 8 million daily players according to the developers [Riot Games](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/). Taking in the top 0.5% of players of such a large player-base into account, it becomes vital to understand what factors contribute the most into a winning game, where minor advantages to a team can snowball heavily into a win. Game data analytics allow developers to study patterns in player behavior and overall trends within a game, with such analysis enabling shifts in the game meta that suits the company's goals. Such understanding in turn enables for a model that can decipher the weighted importance of each factor of the game, whether that be 'First Bloods', 'Dragons' or some other objective. Conclusively, it enables future features to be implemented, suited to support the company's agenda such as a more passive-focused game average with lower kill-counts or a more hyper-aggressive objective focus that places a neutral objective such as the 'Herald' at a high importance. \n",

    "In essence, the main objective of this project is to decipher which factors contribute the most into a conclusive win. Exploratory data analysis utilizing some descriptive statistics and data visualization tools will be used to assist in offering insight as to different patterns and relationships that can be seen within LoL ranked games. Doing so will enable us to achieve our end-goal for the project, as well as offering extra understanding to the prominence that other factors may play in generating a winning lead for the team."

    "Rise of the “eSports” genre has brought forth an element of competitive play similar to physical sports with the NBA, AFL, MLB and others - organized teams that compete for victory against one another. Winning as an organized team is however subjectively easier to winning with a random selection of teammates, and in the case of eSports such as League of Legends that force random, temporary teams, nearing the upper echelons becomes increasingly difficult where more coordinated plays within a team become more and more apparent. It begs the question how top players in the top leagues are still able to flourish in highly competitive and coordinated environments, each with new teammates to cooperate with. This literature review, through existing journal articles and conference papers, aims to uncover the many other elements that contribute towards a team’s chance of winning a match that is not present in our predominantly nominal dataset. As such, understanding underlying themes such as the motivations of players, the social influences one must adapt in order to strive, as well as the skills that are utilized to both better and maintain such abilities are vital to interpret how different, external factors can influence the winning chances of a match."

    "Unlike traditional sports that maintain a focus on team-play, League of Legends ranked games (unlike it’s professional counterpart) is a predominantly solo-focused game. Multiplayer elements that force the player to work in random teams are constantly juxtaposed with individual interest such as the champion a player wishes to play, what role they wish to play in the team or their motivation and purpose for playing the game. Alongside is the element of randomization in matchmaking for both a player’s allies and enemies. Within such games that facilitates a constant balance between cooperation within the team as well as decision making that can put the team at an advantage over the enemy, the prominence of cooperation becomes highly sought after as a factor that influences winning the match [[1]](#source1). As a result of this, cooperation is more apparent in games with a “higher collective intelligence” [[1]](#source1) - higher ELO games with many players that have an inherent understanding of the fundamentals necessary to winning a game. Whether this communication be through pings or team chat: “the overall level of interaction within a network is related to a stronger performance” [[2]](#source2) - not exclusively belonging to the higher ladder but being more common throughout. Similarly, conflict that arises within a team demonstrates negative effects on the winning chances [[3]](#source3). The converse of a team-oriented group, a more centralized “shot-caller” approach, depicts the act of centralization as a “negative influence” [[2]](#source2). This forces many players to adapt and develop an “equal” mindset in order to maintain functional team cooperation within each match [[8]](#source8). It is likewise a sign to take a break when a player is unable to maintain a steady mindset, with one study’s interviewee stating that: “playing while angry or stressed makes you surprisingly bad at League of Legends. Take a break from time to time” [[8]](#source8), highlighting the importance of individual performance in functional team cooperation and extensively, winning the game."

    "Likewise to benefits, factors that inhibit chances of winning a match expand from more than just a weak team-link. Including many debilitating behaviours ranging from abusive language, griefing, to more personal factors such as poor individual performance or playing an unfamiliar role [[13]](#source13), these behaviours often stem from a variety of uncontrollable circumstances. Likewise, the term “tilting” [[7]](#source7) within a player encompasses unregulated emotions that can influence their individual performance, decision making, and are often a result of uncontrollable circumstances such as frustration towards an underperforming player [[7]](#source7). As a consequence, players are naturally inclined to surrender the match and move on to the next match [[12]](#source12). Such results of conflict ultimately diminish winning chances [[3, 13]](#source3) as well as further individual performance [[6]](#source6). Player behaviour and interaction with one another thus becomes vital to maintain, ensuring consistency in winning the match, especially higher up the ranking ladder where every match counts [[11]](#source11); “They discipline their own ways of interaction to facilitate collaboration” [[8]](#source8)."

    "Regardless of how efficient a team may be, it is nevertheless a requirement for players within the team to understand which aspects of the game are placed of higher priority, that is, decision making may serve as a crowning factor in influencing the result of a game. One article depicts the improvement in probabilistic inference within action video games [[4]](#source4), draws attention to the element of randomization that inhibits “standard learning paradigms”. Due to such, players become naturally adept at consciously making “better” decisions through experience - speculations that “neural mechanisms are responsible for a faster transfer of learning.” Under the clause that “situations are rarely, if ever, repeated”, this further highlights how higher ranked, more experienced players are often more adequate at making satisfactory decisions than many other players, possessing a rank that reflects such skills and is potentially a part as to why they climb the ladder in the first place [[5]](#source5). \n"

    "Many game companies offer rewards to diminish decline in intrinsic motivation, potentially playing a role in the “underlying motivational regulations for playing LoL” [[10]](#source10). Such a goal or reward may come in a multitude of ways, whether that be through personal development, proving one’s ability, glory, fame or money. Due to such, “A player’s motivation towards playing a game shapes their player experience and in-game behaviour” [[10]](#source10). Conversely, one’s experience may also shape a player’s motivation to continue improvement within the game [[5]](#source5). Such values that serve as clear reflections to one another epitomizes what allows top performers of the LoL player base to flourish in their competitive environments unlike more casual play, that is, to attain the goal or reward they desire and the motivation to continue pushing for said goal/reward. Regardless of the goal or reward, studies have proven that the reward one receives for their effort “increases their effort and improves performance” [[5]](#source5). Alongside such, it has likewise been illustrated how a more identified group continues to push their limits in contrast to a less identified group, whose motivation begins to decline along with their effort and motivation to play the game [[5]](#source5). This is especially highlighted in higher ranks of the ladder; players that belong to the top 0.5% are naturally identified as “the best” within the player base, potentially serving as a contributing factor allowing players to naturally continue seeking for new paths of improvement that better their chances of winning.\n"

    "It is apparent that winning a match is not exclusive to mere statistics, as many external factors play a crucial role in enabling victory within a team. Temporary teams that exhibit such desirable qualities such as cooperation, effective communication and a good understanding of the game at its core prove to have a greater chance of winning. Within these qualities, it is likewise more commonplace within higher ranked matches to encounter said characteristics - the motivation to win a game pushes players to continue to exhibit and develop these qualities in pursuit of their goals.\n",
