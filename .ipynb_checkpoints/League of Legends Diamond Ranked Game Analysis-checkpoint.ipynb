    "Recent years has shown exponential growth towards the eSports genre, with League of Legends currently standing as one of the most popular video game and eSport being played in the world with over 8 million daily players according to the developers [Riot Games](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/). Taking in the top 0.5% of players of such a large player-base into account, it becomes vital to understand what factors contribute the most into a winning game, where minor advantages to a team can snowball heavily into a win. Game data analytics allow developers to study patterns in player behavior and overall trends within a game, with such analysis enabling shifts in the game meta that suits the company's goals. Such understanding in turn enables for a model that can decipher the weighted importance of each factor of the game, whether that be 'First Bloods', 'Dragons' or some other objective. Conclusively, it enables future features to be implemented, suited to support the company's agenda such as a more passive-focused game average with lower kill-counts or a more hyper-aggressive objective focus that places a neutral objective such as the 'Herald' at a high importance. \n",

    "In essence, the main objective of this project is to decipher which factors contribute the most into a conclusive win. Exploratory data analysis utilizing some descriptive statistics and data visualization tools will be used to assist in offering insight as to different patterns and relationships that can be seen within LoL ranked games. Doing so will enable us to achieve our end-goal for the project, as well as offering extra understanding to the prominence that other factors may play in generating a winning lead for the team."
